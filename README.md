Business task about demand analysis
This is an exercise from Google Data Analytics Certificate. They gave me a case study to solve: a marketing team looking for insights from a bike sharing company.
The marketing team asks for information about different uses of the service by different client types. 
There is an interesting aspect of geographical information that can allow the company to focus on specific areas to conduct marketing campaigns
